      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi I'm Jerry! I'm passionate about utilizing AI and smart technology to reimagine the everyday tools we use, making them smarter, simpler, and more helpful. I'm especially interested in how innovation can be leveraged to address real-world problems and enhance people's lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, I've had the chance to found and lead a few initiatives: I'm currently the Founder and President of EmpowerAIM, Co-Founder and CEO of H&Z Solutions, part of the team at Future of Technology, and President of KidsToKids, a registered international non-profit. I'm also a high school student in the IB program at Upper Canada College.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always learning, building, and exploring new ideas. Feel free to connect, reach out and follow along as I go.
